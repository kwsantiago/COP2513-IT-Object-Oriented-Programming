# Simple JSON Class 

In many java applications values can be stored in a file format called JSON which is just a txt file with
some simple rules. Regular JSON has a lot of useful features and types of data, but for this assignment we
will use a simple JSON. The name section of the format can be any string of characters and numbers, and the number section can be
any decimal integer.
